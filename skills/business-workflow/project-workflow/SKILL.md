## Handling Difficult Situations

### Situation 1: Client Wants Major Changes After Approval

**Response**:
"I understand you'd like to make these changes. Since we've already completed the approved design phase, these would be considered additional revisions. The cost for this scope change would be RM [X]. Would you like me to prepare a quote?"

### Situation 2: Client Delays Providing Content

**Response**:
"Hi [Client], we're ready for your content to continue development. To keep us on track for your [Launch Date], I'll need the content by [Date]. Otherwise, we may need to push the launch date back. Let me know if you need help with content creation (additional RM [X])."

### Situation 3: Client Wants Free Extra Features

**Response**:
"That's a great idea! This feature wasn't included in the original scope, so it would be an add-on of RM [X]. Would you like me to add it to the project?"

### Situation 4: Client Unhappy with Design

**Response**:
"I want to make sure you're completely happy with the design. Can you share some examples of what you're envisioning? Remember, we have [X] rounds of revisions included. Let's schedule a call to discuss your feedback."
