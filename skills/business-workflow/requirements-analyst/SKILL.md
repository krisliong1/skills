## Key Principles

2. **Clarify Vague Requests**: "Modern website" means different things to different people
3. **Set Realistic Expectations**: Be honest about timelines and complexity
4. **Document Everything**: Written agreements prevent misunderstandings
5. **Identify Deal-Breakers Early**: Budget, timeline, technical impossibilities
6. **Educate Clients**: Help them understand what they're asking for
7. **Scope Creep Prevention**: Clearly define what's included and what's extra

### Scenario 3: "I need it done in 2 weeks"

**Response approach**:
- Assess if it's realistically achievable

- Identify what can be rushed vs what can't
- Propose alternatives (soft launch, phased delivery)

### Scenario 4: "I don't know what I want, just make it nice"

**Response approach**:
